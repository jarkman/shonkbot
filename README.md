# quickshonk

A slight variation on the [normal shonkbot](https://github.com/jarkman/shonkbot)
that goes somewhat faster while being somewhat less accurate.

 * Hopefully just as cheap
 * Certainly less well documented
 * Probably not as suited to drawing things; "all jelly and no toast"
 * Not yet properly integrated with shonkbot (related behaviour but with no shared code yet)

AccelStepper is not needed.
